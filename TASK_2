Task: Write a program to compute the centripetal force, centripetal acceleration, and angular velocity of an object moving in a circular path. 
Input the mass, radius, and velocity or angular velocity as needed.

Develop a library that incoorporates the necessary functions or classes to perform essential calculations required by users. 
Also submit a document file about the things you learned while doing the task( be it mathematics, logic or even code syntax ).

Documentation is mandatory regardless of whether the task is completed.If the task is not completed, provide a detailed explanation of the technical 
reasons or challenges that prevented its completion.
